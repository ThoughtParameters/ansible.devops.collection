minor_changes:
  - "CI - Merged the separate workflows for creating a GitHub release and publishing to Ansible Galaxy into a single, unified `release-and-publish.yml` workflow."
  - "CI - The new workflow is composed of two distinct jobs: `release` and `publish`. The `publish` job is dependent on the successful completion of the `release` job."
  - "CI - The built Ansible collection tarball is now passed between the `release` and `publish` jobs using workflow artifacts. This improves reliability over the previous method of downloading the asset from a GitHub Release."
  - "CI - The entire release and publish process is now triggered from a single `workflow_dispatch` event, simplifying the operational steps required to release a new version."

breaking_changes:
  - |
      CI - The previous separate workflows (`release.yml` and `publish.yml`) have been removed. Users must now use the new `release-and-publish.yml`
      workflow to handle both releasing and publishing the collection.
  - |
      CI - The input parameters for the workflow have changed. The new workflow only requires a single `version_bump` input to determine the type of version
      increment (major, minor, patch, or initial).
  - |
      CI - The `publish` job no longer rebuilds the collection artifact. Instead, it relies on the artifact produced by the `release` job. This means any
      changes to the collection must be included before triggering the workflow.
  - |
      CI - The GitHub Actions workflow now requires the `contents: write` permission to allow for committing, tagging, and creating releases. Users must
      ensure their repository settings accommodate this permission level.
